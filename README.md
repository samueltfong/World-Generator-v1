# World-Generator-v1
A simple ASCII world generator built using Unity Engine using Cellular Automata

Rough test :/
(If you want to try this out for yourself, there is basically no documentation cuz im bad, but just create a new 2D project in unity and replace the projects "Assets" folder with the one here. Then load the "WorldGenScene")
